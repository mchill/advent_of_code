# Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).

I originally solved the 2015 puzzles using C++, and later repeated them using
Ruby. I solved the 2016 puzzles using Python, and the 2017 puzzles using Go.
After missing two years, I solved the 2020 puzzles using C#.
